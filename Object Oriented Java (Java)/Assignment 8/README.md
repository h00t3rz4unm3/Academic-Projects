### _Assignment 8_  

1.  
  **a.** Create a recursive static method called _summation_ that will take in 2 parameters of type int and return the sum of all of the numbers from the 1st number to the 2nd number (including the 1st and last number). Assume the 1st parameter is less than or equal to the 2nd parameter.

  **b.** Create another method called _summation2_, which does the same thing as summation except that the 1st parameter could be less than the 2nd.


2.  
  **a.** Create a recursive method in class _Node_. Call it _partialSum_. The method should return the sum of the data value of Node the method was called on and the sum of the data values of all of the Nodes after it in the LinkedList. For example, if the values in the nodes in the list are 1 through 13, and method partial sum is called on the 7th node, the method should return 70.

  **b.** Create a method in class _LinkedList_ called _printBack()_ on its head variable. Create method _printBack_ in class Node. This method should output to the console in reverse order the data values in each node from the last node in the list until the current node. 
 
 
So, for the example in part 2a, the output should look like: **13 12 11 10 9 8 7**
