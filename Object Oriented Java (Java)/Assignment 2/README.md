### _Assignment 2_

Create a class with a main method that creates 2 arrays, each of size 50 (or a length of 50 if you prefer)   .
One should be an array of Strings and the other an array of ints.  

Use the random method of class Math to generate 50 numbers between the values 0 and 1000.  

Populate the array of ints with these 50 numbers. Convert the numbers to Strings and populate the array of Strings with the String representation of these 50 numbers.

Print out each unsorted array. Use 2 for loops to iterate through the arrays. First print out all of the int values (on one line) then print out all the String values (on the next line).  

Call a *Bubble Sorting* method and pass the array of ints to it. Call a *Selection Sort* method and pass the array of Strings to it.  

You will have to create a new Selection Sort method.  

Print out both arrays. They should both be sorted.
