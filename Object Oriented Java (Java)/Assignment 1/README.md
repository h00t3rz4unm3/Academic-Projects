Create a class that asks the user for a number. Use a JOptionPane.  
Create an array of characters (chars) which is of equal size to the string that the user input.  
Using a for loop, check each char in the String that the user input to make sure they are all digits.  
If any of the characters are not a digit, display an appropriate message to the user using another JOptionPane.  
If all of the characters are digits, display in JoptionPane the number in reverse.
