#### _Assignment 1_
1. Suppose we are given a data file (data1.txt) which contains integers. We are interested to know:  
  a. How many integers in data.txt  
  b. The largest integer in data.txt  
  c. The smallest integer in data.txt  
  d. The average of all the integers in data.txt  


#### _Project 1_
1. Suppose we are given a data file (data1.txt) which contains integers. We are interested to know:  
  a. How many integers in data.txt  
  b. The largest integer in data.txt  
  c. The smallest integer in data.txt  
  d. The average of all the integers in data.txt  

Same as Assignment 1, but implement _selection sort_  


#### Project 2 
1-D array implementation of the Insertion Sort  
    Define a Node class that include:  
      - a string variable, named strData  
      - a node pointer, named next  
      - one or two node constructors  

Define a linkedList class that include:  
    - a node pointer, named listHead  
    - a linkedList constructor
